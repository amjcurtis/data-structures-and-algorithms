# Insertion Sort

## Challenge

In this challenge I wrote a static method in C# that takes an integer array as input, sorts it in place using an [insertion sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort) algorithm, and returns the sorted array. 

## Approach & Efficiency

The approach I took in my insertion sort algorithm has the following time and space efficiencies:

Time: O(n^2) (quadratic)

Space: O(1)

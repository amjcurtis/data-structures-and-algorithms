# FizzBuzz Tree

## Challenge

This challenge involved creating a method called `FizzBuzzTree()` that accepts a binary tree of integers as input, traverses the tree and modifies the tree in place by substituting each qualifying integer for *fizz*, *buzz*, or *fizzbuzz* per the rules of FizzBuzz, and returns the tree. 

## Approach & Efficiency

* Time complexity: *O(n)*
* Space complexity: *O(1)*

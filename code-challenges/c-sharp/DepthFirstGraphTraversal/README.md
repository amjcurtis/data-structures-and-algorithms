# Depth-First Graph Traversal

## Challenge

> Conduct a depth-first preorder traversal of a graph

In this challenge I wrote a C# console app containing a
method called `TraverseDepthFirst()` that traverses
a graph datastructure recursively depth-first.
The method takes in a graph vertex and returns a generic
list containing the graph vertices in the order they were traversed.

My solution uses my custom graph implementation. 

## Approach & Efficiency

* Time Efficiency: O(n)
* Space Efficiency: O(n)

# Binary Search of an Array

## Challenge

Write a static method called BinarySearch that takes in two parameters: a sorted array and a 
search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to in your language, 
return the index of the array's element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the 
element is not present in the array.

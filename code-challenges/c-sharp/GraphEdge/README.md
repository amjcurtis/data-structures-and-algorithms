# Find Edges

## Challenge

> Given a business trip itinerary, and an airline
> route map, is the trip possible with direct flights?
> If so, how much will the total trip cost be?

In this challenge I wrote a C# console app containing a
method called `GetEdges()` that solves the problem above.
The method takes in a graph and an array of city names as
inputs and returns whether the trip is possible with direct
flights and how much the trip would cost.

My solution uses my custom graph implementation. 

## Approach & Efficiency

* Time Efficiency: O(n)
* Space Efficiency: O(1)

## Solution

I collaborated with [Vanessa Wei](https://github.com/Wei9023) on the whiteboard solution for this challenge.

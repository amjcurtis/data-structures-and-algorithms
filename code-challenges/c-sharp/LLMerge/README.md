# Zip Two Singly Linked Lists Together

## Challenge

Write a method called MergeLists that takes in two linked lists as arguments and "zips" them together in place, merging them so that the two list' nodes alternate in sequence in the resulting single list.

## Approach & Efficiency

This approach merges the two lists in place.

Time Complexity O(log *n*)
Space Complexity: O(1)

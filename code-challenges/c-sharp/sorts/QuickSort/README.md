# Quick Sort

## Challenge

In this challenge I implemented a quick sort algorithm written in C#. The algorithm consists of three methods, `QuickSort()`, `Partition()`, and `Swap()`. The algorithm operates on the input array in place and does so recursively. 

## Approach & Efficiency

The approach I took in my quick sort algorithm has the following time and space efficiencies:

Time: best and average cases O(n log n), worst case O(n^2)

Space: O(log n)

# Queue with Stacks

## Challenge

This challenge involved creating a console app that simulates the *enqueue* and *dequeue* methods of a queue data structure while actually using not a queue but only two *stack* data structures. All the methods of the stack data structure (`Push()`, `Pop()`, `Peek()`) are available for use in this exercise. The simulated `Enqueue()` and `Dequeue()` methods live in a class called `PseudoQueue<T>` which I implemented as generic (`<T>`).  

## Approach & Efficiency

The approach I took has an efficiency of O(1) time for the `Enqueue()` method and O(n) time for the `Dequeue()` method.
